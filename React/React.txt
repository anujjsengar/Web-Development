-------------------------> REACT <-------------------
Required: JS, ES6(Classes,Arrow Fn,import export,let var const,destructing);

React --> Library(On basis of JS)  --> Facebook  (Easy the work)
Its is Library work as framework thats why it is Light-weighted


Why React ? 
`````Single Page Application(Reloading Nahi hogi)
`````Component Based Architecture (Tukedo m code krna:- Divide the application into small part and integrate it)
`````Faster(Light Weight)  It is Faster because it doent reload just reflect change
`````Reusablity(Component can be used further without again write it)
`````Virtual DOM(Important);

DOM:Document.getElemenetByID;
    Create Element 
    inner HTML
    Append
Render all component again and create all compoennt 
Why not DOM:-
`````````It is very heavy operationally(Time complexity,More network call) solved by Virtual DOM
`````````On change in a component Render all component again and create all component and scratch it overcome by Virtual DOM

Virtual DOM:-
It compares to previous DOM and new DOM need to create and render only new created or changing component only;
only change recreate krta hai...

Disadvantages of REACT:-->
``````Bed SEO 
``````Frontend Library
``````NO SSR(some special ways only SSR)
``````No own router
