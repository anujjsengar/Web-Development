-------------------------> REACT <-------------------
Required: JS, ES6(Classes,Arrow Fn,import export,let var const,destructing);

React --> Library(On basis of JS)  --> Facebook  (Easy the work)
Its is Library work as framework thats why it is Light-weighted


Why React ? 
`````Single Page Application(Reloading Nahi hogi)
`````Component Based Architecture (Tukedo m code krna:- Divide the application into small part and integrate it)
`````Faster(Light Weight)  It is Faster because it doent reload just reflect change
`````Reusablity(Component can be used further without again write it)
`````Virtual DOM(Important);

DOM:Document.getElemenetByID;
    Create Element 
    inner HTML
    Append
Render all component again and create all compoennt 
Why not DOM:-
`````````It is very heavy operationally(Time complexity,More network call) solved by Virtual DOM
`````````On change in a component Render all component again and create all component and scratch it overcome by Virtual DOM

Virtual DOM:-
It compares to previous DOM and new DOM need to create and render only new created or changing component only;
only change recreate krta hai...

Disadvantages of REACT:-->
``````Bad SEO 
``````Frontend Library Only(No Backend)
``````NO SSR(some special ways only SSR)
``````No own router-->Shift to NEXT.JS

---->Bad SEO-:
CSR(Client Side Rendering)                  |            SSR(Server Side Rendering)
No Reloading(Single Page Application)        |
Page Content change                            |
Brower(Webcrawler)                                 |
Naya content read nhi kr paata webcrawler               |

React 18(Last Version)


Difference Between React and ReactDOM
React-Create Component
ReactDOM- Show component(Web)
ReactNative - show component(App)


Babel is compiler used to compiler to convert jsx to pure js

Bundlers:---->
```````Webpacks/Parcel/Vite(Budlers All jsx convert JS AND THIS ALL JS INTO SINGLE JS)

ALL JSX--->ALL JS-->SINGLE JS(Done By Bundlers-->(Webpacks,Parcel,Vite))
we work on src folder and dist folder go on production

components  ---->App.jsx ----> main.jsx ---->index.html

rfce(React Functional Export Component)


Types of compoennt:-
//Class Based--->Dynamic component  -->Dynamic changes
//Function Based---->Static component --->Static changes

//hooks----->predefined Function(UsinG with Function BASED for dynamic changes)

//import export
