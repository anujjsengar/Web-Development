---------------------->Function<---------------------
Function is a block of code used to perform a particular task to achieve the work done.
1.Function Declaration
2.Function Calling
3.Parameterised Function
4.Functional Expression
5.1st class functions
6.Anonymous Function
7.Higher Outer Function
8.Callback functions


function calling -working -returning(auto undefined return)


Note In java function canbe stored int an varaible because let defined function not have datatype defined


whenever i stored entire funtion inside a varaible it is called -:
Function Expression
First class function
first class citizens



#How Function run behind the scene

define varaible have 3 way:
var name;
let name;
const name;


whenever a JS code is run a global execution contect created


GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT ---->Two Phases :- MCP(Memory Creation Phase) and CEP(Code execution Phase)
MCP--->Memory Created or alloted to(Variable and Function) to execute the code(before running code)
memory alloted to varaible but assign as undefined during execution value assign 


CEP--->Actual Execution of code(Execute a line by line execution)
Override the undefined or alloted variable to actual variable value;

whenever a function is run then a new Execution Contect Created for particular function like  stack in java;


After complete execution done Memory destroy or Execution contex destoy;
