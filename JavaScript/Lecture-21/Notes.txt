After ES6: (3 ways);

2.const
3.var(Alreaybefore ES6)


reassign or redeclare:------->

let sam=10;
let sam=100;  //redeclare


let sam=10;
sam=100 //reassign



const: Declare and Assignment together   Reassign -Np  Redeclare -No
let  : Declare or Assignment cannot need together -YES Reassign -no redeclare
var  : Declare or Assignment cannot need together -YES Reassign -Yes redeclare


Scopes(Variable):
1. const and let -> block Scope or Global scope(not sure);
2.var --> Functional Scope;
